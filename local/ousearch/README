OU search
=========

Copyright 2014 The Open University


This is a cross-database indexed text-search facility.

It does not do anything on its own, but if you install it alongside
ForumNG, OU blog, or OU wiki then it will provide full text search for
those modules.

Support:

We cannot offer direct support. Please do not contact me directly. If you
need assistance, try the relevant forum on moodle.org.

Bug reports:

Please report bugs using the 'Issues' tab on GitHub above.

Before reporting a bug, please ensure you are running the latest version of
the plugin that is available from:

https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-local_ousearch

In the bug report, please include your Moodle version (e.g. 2.3.2) and your
ousearch version (which you can find in the file local/ousearch/version.php). 

Status:

Development code that has not been tested and may contain serious bugs.
Please see the branches (MOODLE_xx_STABLE) for tested code.

Requires:

Moodle 2.7+
Postgres / MySQL

Install:

Place the contents of this source tree into your Moodle installation so that
within your Moodle root, this file is local/ousearch/README. Then visit the
Moodle notifications page to install.

If you have existing searchable content (i.e. existing installations of
ForumNG, OU wiki, or OU blog) then in order to make search work, after
completing installation you must manually visit this script within your
Moodle:

http://your.server/.../local/ousearch/postinstall.php

This script will build the search index for all existing content.

Documentation:

See 'doc' folder. This documentation may be out of date. It is aimed mainly
at module developers who might wish to use ousearch in their own modules.
