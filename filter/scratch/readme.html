<h1>Scratch Filter for Moodle 2</h1>
<p>This filter allows to embed Scratch games easily into a Moodle based virtual learning environment:</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>This filter allows you to embed Scratch games into labels, forums, or web pages automatically - wherever you create a link to a .sb Scratch file that has been uploaded onto the Moodle server (either as an attachment to a forum post, or as a course file).</p>
<p>This not only allows you to use Scratch files as teaching aids, examples, or games but also allows students to share their own Scratch games with other students via a forum, giving and receiving feedback and learning from each other's scripts.</p>
<h2>To install / configure:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Unzip the Scratch plugin folder to the filters folder on your Moodle server</li>
  <li>Log in as administrator and visit the notifications page.</li>
  <li>Enable the Scratch filter (Modules &gt; Filters &gt; Manage Filters)</li>
  <li>Change the settings to enable or disable autoplay (Modules &gt; Filters &gt; Scratch)</li>
  <li>Test out the plugin by adding a link to a Scratch file in a label or creating a forum post with a Scratch file as an attachment</li>
</ol>
